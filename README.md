# FLIGHT_ROUTES_CLUSTERING_PROJECT
Data Clustering Project
This project involves using K-means clustering to analyze a dataset of routes. The goal is to group similar data points together based on selected features.

Introduction
In this project, we use K-means clustering to identify patterns and groupings within a dataset containing route information. The data is read from a CSV file using the pandas library, and K-means clustering is applied to the dataset. The clusters are visualized using a scatter plot.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib) installed.
Place your routes.csv dataset in the project directory.
Usage
Run the main.py script. This script reads the routes.csv dataset using the pandas library and performs K-means clustering on the data.
The clusters are visualized using a scatter plot, with each data point's color representing its cluster assignment.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
